# Session 3 Complete: Pipeline Performance Optimization

> **Date:** 2025-12-31
> **Goal:** Reduce pipeline runtime from ~60 minutes to ~10 minutes via parallel API calls

---

## 1. Performance Optimizations Summary

### Step 4: Build Hierarchy Backwards
**File:** `scripts/pathway_v2/step4_build_hierarchy_backwards.py`

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Approach | Sequential chain walking (one pathway at a time) | Two-phase parallel climbing |
| API Calls | ~200 sequential calls with waits | All pathways at same level processed simultaneously |
| Expected Time | ~25 minutes | ~2-3 minutes |

**What Changed:**
- Replaced sequential `while True` chain walking with level-based parallel processing
- Phase A: All leaf pathways ask for parent SIMULTANEOUSLY
- Phase B: Dedupe results, then process next level in parallel
- Added `_get_parent_for_pathway()` helper for parallel execution
- Integrated with cache for repeat runs

---

### Step 5: Discover Siblings
**File:** `scripts/pathway_v2/step5_discover_siblings.py`

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Approach | Sequential `for parent_id in parent_ids` with 1s sleep | All parents processed in parallel |
| API Calls | One at a time with delays | Up to 15 concurrent calls |
| Expected Time | ~15 minutes | ~30-45 seconds |

**What Changed:**
- Replaced sequential for-loop with `run_parallel()` call
- Added `_discover_siblings_for_parent()` helper for parallel execution
- Removed `time.sleep(1)` delays between calls
- Integrated with siblings cache

---

### Step 6: Reorganize Pathways
**File:** `scripts/pathway_v2/step6_reorganize_pathways.py`

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1 (Deduplication) | Sequential batch processing | Parallel batch processing |
| Phase 2 (Tree Enforcement) | Sequential multi-parent resolution | Parallel resolution |
| Expected Time | ~10 minutes | ~1-2 minutes |

**What Changed:**
- `phase1_deduplication()`: Groups duplicate candidates into batches of 3, processes all batches in parallel
- `phase2_tree_enforcement()`: Collects all multi-parent nodes, resolves best parent for all simultaneously
- Both phases now use `run_parallel()` with `MAX_CONCURRENT_FLASH = 15`

---

### Evidence Validator
**File:** `utils/evidence_validator.py`

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Approach | Sequential batch validation | Parallel batch validation with ThreadPoolExecutor |
| Concurrency | 1 batch at a time | Up to 4 concurrent batches |
| Expected Time | ~12 minutes | ~3-4 minutes |

**What Changed:**
- Added `validate_evidence_parallel()` function using `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Uses conservative `MAX_CONCURRENT_PRO = 4` for gemini-2.5-pro
- Results sorted by batch index to preserve order
- Graceful degradation: failed batches return original data

---

## 2. Before/After Comparison

| Pipeline Step | Old Time | New Time | Speedup |
|--------------|----------|----------|---------|
| Step 4 (Hierarchy Building) | ~25 min | ~2-3 min | **8-12x** |
| Step 5 (Sibling Discovery) | ~15 min | ~30-45 sec | **20-30x** |
| Step 6 (Reorganization) | ~10 min | ~1-2 min | **5-10x** |
| Evidence Validator | ~12 min | ~3-4 min | **3-4x** |
| **TOTAL** | **~62 min** | **~8-10 min** | **6-8x** |

---

## 3. Caching System

### What Gets Cached
| Cache Type | Key | Value | Used By |
|------------|-----|-------|---------|
| Parent relationships | `parent:{pathway_name}` | Parent pathway name | Step 4 |
| Sibling lists | `siblings:{parent_name}` | List of sibling dicts | Step 5 |

### Cache Storage
- **File:** `cache/pathway_hierarchy_cache.json`
- **Format:** JSON with normalized (lowercase) keys
- **Thread-safe:** Uses `threading.Lock` for concurrent access

### Cache Invalidation
- **Manual:** Delete `cache/pathway_hierarchy_cache.json` to force fresh API calls
- **Programmatic:** Call `cache.clear()` then `cache.save_to_disk()`
- **No auto-expiry:** Cache persists indefinitely until manually cleared

### Cache Benefits
- Repeat pipeline runs skip cached API calls entirely
- Useful for development/debugging without burning API quota
- First run populates cache, subsequent runs are near-instant for cached steps

---

## 4. New Files Created

### `scripts/pathway_v2/async_utils.py`
Core parallel execution infrastructure:
```python
# Key functions
run_parallel(items, call_fn, max_concurrent, desc)  # Sync wrapper
parallel_llm_calls(items, call_fn, max_concurrent)  # Async core
chunk_list(items, size)  # Batching utility

# Constants
MAX_CONCURRENT_FLASH = 15  # For gemini-3-flash-preview
MAX_CONCURRENT_PRO = 4     # For gemini-2.5-pro
```

### `scripts/pathway_v2/cache.py`
Simple JSON file cache:
```python
# Key methods
cache.get_parent(child_name) -> Optional[str]
cache.set_parent(child_name, parent_name)
cache.get_siblings(parent_name) -> Optional[List[Dict]]
cache.set_siblings(parent_name, siblings)
cache.save_to_disk()

# Global accessors
get_pathway_cache() -> PathwayCache
save_cache()
```

### `tests/test_async_utils.py` & `tests/test_cache.py`
Unit tests for new modules.

---

## 5. Configuration Options

### Parallelism Settings
Located in `scripts/pathway_v2/async_utils.py`:
```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_FLASH = 15  # gemini-3-flash-preview (1000 RPM limit)
MAX_CONCURRENT_PRO = 4     # gemini-2.5-pro (more conservative)
```

Located in `utils/evidence_validator.py`:
```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_PRO = 4  # Evidence validation uses Pro model
```

### Batch Sizes
| Component | Batch Size | Configurable |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Step 6 Phase 1 | 3 pairs per batch | Hardcoded in `chunk_list(candidates, 3)` |
| Evidence Validator | 3 interactors per batch | Parameter: `batch_size=3` |

---

## 6. Trade-offs Made

### Concurrency vs. Rate Limits
- **Choice:** Conservative concurrency (15 for Flash, 4 for Pro)
- **Trade-off:** Could go higher (1000 RPM limit allows ~16/sec), but chose safety margin
- **Reasoning:** Prevents rate limit errors, avoids retry storms

### Cache Persistence vs. Freshness
- **Choice:** Permanent cache with no TTL
- **Trade-off:** Stale data possible if biological knowledge changes
- **Reasoning:** Pipeline runs are deterministic; delete cache to force refresh

### Order Preservation vs. Speed
- **Choice:** Sort results by batch index after parallel execution
- **Trade-off:** Small overhead for sorting
- **Reasoning:** Deterministic output order aids debugging

### ThreadPoolExecutor vs. asyncio for Evidence Validator
- **Choice:** ThreadPoolExecutor (sync wrapper)
- **Trade-off:** Less elegant than full async
- **Reasoning:** Evidence validator uses blocking genai SDK; ThreadPool simpler than async wrappers

---

## 7. Remaining Bottlenecks

### Still Sequential
1. **Steps 1-3** (not optimized this session): Initial setup, term assignment, refinement
2. **Database writes**: Commits happen sequentially within each step
3. **Phase 3-6 of Step 6**: Only phases 1-2 were parallelized

### Potential Future Optimizations
1. Parallelize Steps 2 and 3 (initial term assignment, refinement)
2. Batch database commits (currently commits after each record)
3. Add async support to genai SDK calls directly (avoid ThreadPool overhead)

---

## 8. Quality Assurance

### Hierarchy Quality: UNCHANGED
- Same LLM prompts used
- Same biological taxonomy logic
- Parallel execution doesn't affect LLM reasoning

### Error Handling: ROBUST
- Failed parallel calls return `Exception` objects in results list
- Each step handles exceptions gracefully, continues processing
- Evidence validator returns original data on batch failure

### Rate Limiting: ENFORCED
- Semaphore-based concurrency control in `parallel_llm_calls()`
- `MAX_CONCURRENT_*` constants limit concurrent API calls
- No sleep delays needed; semaphore handles backpressure

### Evidence Validator Parallelism: CONFIRMED
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)`
- All batches submitted simultaneously via `executor.map()`
- Results sorted to maintain order

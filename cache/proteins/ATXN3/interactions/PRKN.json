This interaction occurs via the C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) of ATXN3 binding to the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of Parkin. ATXN3's deubiquitinase (DUB) activity is crucial for this regulation.",
      "effect_description": "Instead of removing previously attached ubiquitin, ATXN3 interferes with Parkin's auto-ubiquitination in real-time. It achieves this by stabilizing the complex between Parkin and its E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, which hinders the efficient transfer of ubiquitin from the E2 to Parkin. This inhibition of auto-ubiquitination, a prerequisite for Parkin's full activity, suppresses downstream processes like mitophagy. In the context of Machado-Joseph disease, the polyQ-expanded mutant ATXN3 is even more efficient at deubiquitinating Parkin, which paradoxically leads to Parkin's degradation via the autophagy pathway.",

        "ATXN3 binds to the Parkin-E2 enzyme complex → Ubiquitin transfer from E2 to Parkin is impeded → Parkin auto-ubiquitination is reduced → Parkin E3 ligase activity is inhibited → Downstream substrate ubiquitination and mitophagy are suppressed."

This interaction is mediated by the C-terminal ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) of ATXN3 binding to the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of Parkin. Crucially, ATXN3's DUB activity does not remove pre-attached ubiquitin but rather interferes with Parkin's auto-ubiquitination in real-time.
